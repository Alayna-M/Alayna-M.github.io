# Welcome to my portfolio!

### About Me
ðŸ’» I'm a CS student in my final year of undergrad and an awardee of the DoD SMART Scholar Program.
ðŸ’Ÿ I've found my main passions relating to CS lie in the visual creative elements, especially 3D modeling/rigging, photogrammetry, and procedural generation.
ðŸ‘¾ In my free time I enjoy gaming, reading, and playing racquetball and volleyball.

### Code Under: /Node_Express
[Link to Files](https://github.com/Alayna-M/Alayna-M.github.io/tree/main/Node_Express)
- Goal was to practice basics of Node and Express via creating a simple website that stores a users info.
- Used Node.js, Express.js, HTML, CSS, and Visual Studio Code.
- Solo project that reqruied setting up a basic backend/frontend, creating a userinfo.txt file to store data, and making 2 html forms for the user to fill out.
- Debugging involved isolating issues caused by empty lines not being removed from the data file.

# Connect Four #

### Code Under: /Connect_Four
[Link to Files](https://github.com/Alayna-M/Alayna-M.github.io/tree/main/Connect_Four)
- Goal was to extend a simple tic-tac-toe game into a connect four game using React.
- Used React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code.
- Solo project that included editing css styling to fit the connect four theme and creating logic for full gameplay.
- The biggest hurdle for this one was figuring out the best way to check for player wins, specifically the diagnols.

### Code Under: /Mongo_RESTful
[Link to Files](https://github.com/Alayna-M/Alayna-M.github.io/tree/main/Mongo_RESTful)
- Goal was to create a backend for a simple banking system utilizing Node, Express, and Mongo.
- Used Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, RESTful API, and Visual Studio Code.
- Solo project that included setting up API routes, validating data, setting up MongoDB connections, and creating base logic for simple transactions and account creation.
- Learning how to utilize RESTful was the biggest challenge here, as I had never used it before.

# Hangman #

### Code Under: /Hangman
[Link to Files](https://github.com/Alayna-M/Alayna-M.github.io/tree/main/Hangman)
- Goal was to create a basic hangman game with high score storage and retrieval.
- Used React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Sessions, RESTful API, and Visual Studio Code.
- Group project where I was responsible for creating the base skeleton code, logic for tracking guesses and recording session info, routing the user at Game Over event, and polishing up the UI.
- Our teams biggest obstacle was getting a 1000 word bank csv file to pull from for the game. We also debated whether or not to include some simple animation of a stick figure but ultimately decided not to implement it.

### Code Under: /Banking_App
[Link to Files](https://github.com/Alayna-M/Alayna-M.github.io/tree/main/Banking_App)
- Goal was to develop a full-stack banking application with a React frontend and a Node/Express/BongoDB backend.
- UsedReact.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Tailwind CSS, RESTful API, SHA-256, and Visual Studio Code.
- Group project where I was responsible for implementing protected routes, creating an employeeSummary page for viewing account info and handling transactions/transfers (this included things like base UI, error handling, transaction/transfer logic, balance checking, validating information, updating history, etc.). I also assisted my teammates with debugging their routes.
- My biggest hurdle for this project was sorting out how to implement protected routes, especially when my initial approach was causing issues with Tailwind CSS.
