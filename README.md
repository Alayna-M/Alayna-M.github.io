# Welcome to my portfolio!

### About Me
ðŸ’» I'm a CS student in my final year of undergrad and an awardee of the DoD SMART Scholar Program.
ðŸ’Ÿ I've found my main passions relating to CS lie in the visual creative elements, especially 3D modeling/rigging, photogrammetry, and procedural generation.
ðŸ‘¾ In my free time I enjoy gaming, reading, and playing racquetball and volleyball.
